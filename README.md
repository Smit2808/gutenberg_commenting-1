# Google Doc-Style Gutenberg Block Commenting

> **⚠️ Note:** This is a beta version. Use it for contributions only.

## Get feedback Right away!

Current trends say that 35% of the web uses WordPress, from individual blog posts to big news sites online. While preparing any blog or news page online, those people thought of in their mind to verify their content with friends, colleagues, subject experts before posting it. They want to invite and collaborate with other people in blog posts for review/validation. But unfortunately, they do not have any handy features to give feedback/suggestions right away on specific area of those page/post within the WordPress platform.

So, we are happy to announce that we have launched the Pre-alpha/Alpha/Beta version of Comment features. It is available publicly for the WordPress community to contribute. We have done the research and identified specific needs. Based on that we came with a solution where we will provide comments with a native Gutenberg editor in WordPress. Here, every user will provide comments on the text in the Gutenberg blocks.
