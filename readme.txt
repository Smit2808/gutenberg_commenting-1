== Content Collaboration Made Easy for WordPress ==

The ability to <strong>leave comments and suggestions in a more meaningful and results-oriented manner during the content review process</strong> is currently unavailable in the WordPress Gutenberg editor. 

This limits collaborative editing and publishing. Things are prone to get difficult when multiple team members need to review content, and publishers often use Google Docs to place edits and comments collaboratively. 

Multidots has created a plugin that allows <strong>Google-Doc Style editorial commenting from within the WordPress Gutenberg editor.</strong>

This plugin <strong>eliminates time-consuming steps</strong> and the need to move content out of the editor for collaborative feedback and editing.
